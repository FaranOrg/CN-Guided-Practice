## The assignment - what you need to do

1. Before changing any code, answer these questions.
   1. What is the name of the root component?
   2. What are the names of the root's child components?

2. The starter code contains 3 syntax errors that prevent the code from building.  Use the browser to fix an error.  We'll do the first one together.

3. Now that your webpage builds, there are some other errors!  Test out the code by using the page.
There are 3 problems with the page's functionality.  Work with a partner to find the 3 problems.

4. Take 5 minutes to fix the 3 problems.  If you fix all 3, HOORAY!!!!!
